We were asked to build an application to keep track of car inventory using classes and methods that we build exclusively for this application:

* A “Car” class with the following private fields: 
model (string), year (int), color (string), and mileage (double). 

* Properties in order to access thpse fields. 

* A constructor with parameters that can be used to populate all of the fields. 

* A method that returns a string consisting of a model, year, color, and mileage, appropriately formatted. 

* A “CarDM” class for data management that features two static methods: save(List<Car>), and load(). 
The first one should accept a list of car objects and save their field values to a file called “carlist.txt”. 
The second one should read the “carlist.txt” file and generate (and return) a list of “car” type objects populating their fields with values read from the file.
