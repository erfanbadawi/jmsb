We were asked to develop an application for a project that has initial investment, yearly revenue and yearly expenses. Our program should have been able to take these data and calculate the break-even year, i.e. when the cumulative profits become 0. Also, it should have had a listbox that would list the cumulative profit for the number of years, which is double that of a break-even year.
